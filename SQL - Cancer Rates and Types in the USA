Portfolio Project - Analyzing cancer rates and types in the USA

Data sources found at CORGIS (https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/csv/cancer/)

Analyzing the following:
- Breast cancer rates by age group by state
- Breast cancer rate by population older, comparing total rate with rate for people with white skin
- Comparing cancer rates per state for people older that 65 years, combined with 65+ year old population per state 
and calculating a state cancer risk score for people older than 65 years.
