/*

Deleting Duplicates from a top 1000 billionaires database

*/

Select * from Billionaires

------ Problem: Some billionaires have multiple entries in the database, to use this data we only want one row of data per billionaire

------ Method 1: CTE & Partition By - problem: can't exclude the data of the first (or first two) entries, only the second or last two entries. ------
------ We need to remove the first or the first two entries as they are the older entries. ------

WITH RowNumCTE AS(
Select *,
	ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
	PARTITION BY name,
				 rank,
				 company#relationship,
				 location#citizenship
				 ORDER BY
					rank 
					) row_num
From Billionaires
)
Select *
From RowNumCTE
Where row_num > 1
Order by name

------ Method 2: Group by & Having clause ------

-- First we need to add an ID for every row

Alter Table Billionaires
add ID int identity(1,1) 

Select * from Billionaires

-- Checking how many entries we have to remove

Select name, rank, Count(*) as CNT
from Billionaires
Group by name, rank
Having Count(*) > 1;

-- Grouping duplicates together, then selecting the records without the MAX ID (we want to keep those)

Select *
	From Billionaires
	Where ID not in 
	(
		Select Max(ID)
		From Billionaires
		Group by name, rank
	)
;

-- Actually Deleting the data

Delete From Billionaires
	Where ID not in 
	(
		Select Max(ID)
		From Billionaires
		Group by name, rank
	)
;
